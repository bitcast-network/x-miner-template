"""
Prompt templates for brief evaluation.

This module contains all prompt templates used for evaluating tweet content against briefs.
Each version represents a different evaluation approach. The prompt strings are ported
VERBATIM from the old codebase — they are LLM-cache keys and evaluation behavior; do not
reword them.

How to add a new prompt version:
1. Create a new function generate_brief_evaluation_prompt_vX (where X is the version number)
2. Add the function to the PROMPT_GENERATORS registry
3. Update tests to validate the new version
4. Briefs can then specify "prompt_version": X to use the new format

Currently supported versions: v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 (default: v1)
